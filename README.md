<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Rares 👋</h1>
<h3 align="center">Senior Full-Stack Mobile Engineer • React Native • Node.js • TypeScript</h3>

<p align="center">
I turn product ideas into reliable cross-platform apps - from crypto wallets and asset registries to media and university platforms.

### 🚀 What I do

- Build **React Native / Expo** apps that ship to both iOS and Android with one codebase.
- Design and implement **Node.js / TypeScript** backends and APIs that are simple to reason about and easy to maintain.
- Work end-to-end: requirements → architecture → implementation → testing → CI/CD → releases → monitoring.
- Focus on **performance, crash-rate reduction, and developer experience** so teams can move fast without breaking things.

### 💼 A few highlights

#### 🔐 Gridlock - Web3 mobile wallet
- Integrated **NEAR, Cosmos, Astar, Bitcoin, Polkadot native wallets and MetaMask-compatible EVM wallets** into a single mobile wallet.
- Shipped **Astar Portal support in ~2 weeks with 0 crashes at launch**.
- Reduced app load time by ~**30%** through bundle optimization, lazy loading, and caching.
- Improved **WalletConnect** reliability and UX across Ethereum and Solana signing flows.
- Contributed across both **React Native** (mobile) and **Node.js** (backend) to move the product forward.

#### 📦 Olyn - tokenized asset registry
- Delivered a cross-platform asset-registry app in **React Native**, matching Figma designs with **<2% visual diff** across screens.
- Reached **99%+ crash-free sessions** in beta by tightening error boundaries and adding monitoring.
- Established a maintainable codebase using React Native best practices and a clear separation-of-concerns architecture.
- Reduced defect risk by adopting **TypeScript end-to-end**, including strict typings for third-party libraries.
- Set up advanced project tooling (**ESLint, Prettier, strict TypeScript configs**) to keep the codebase predictable and consistent.

#### 📻 Freelance - radio & university apps
- Built a **University mobile app** as a Bachelor’s thesis, translating the full website functionality into a mobile experience for students and staff.
- Shipped **Jurnal FM** - live radio streaming + a news section for real-time updates.
- Shipped **Radio Ciufulici** - a simple, intuitive, and reliable live radio streaming app.
- Standardized project setup with **TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, GitHub Actions** to keep releases boring and safe.

### 🧠 How I like to work

- Own features **end-to-end** - from early product conversations to post-release metrics.
- Keep PRs **small, readable, and focused**, with tests where they matter most.
- Prefer **clear, async-friendly communication** and good documentation over meetings.
- Care about **DX** (developer experience): fast feedback loops, solid tooling, and clean architecture.
- Always leave the codebase **slightly better** than I found it.
